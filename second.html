  <h2 id="aboutThe">About London</h2>
  <p id="about">London is the capital and most populous city
  of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the
  south east of the island of Great Britain,
  London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded
  by the Romans, who named it Londinium. London's
  ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its 1.12-square-mile
  (2.9 km2) medieval boundaries. Since at least the
  19th century, London has also referred to the metropolis around this
  core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex,
  Surrey, Kent and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater
  London, a region governed by the Mayor of London and the London
  Assembly.</p>

<p class="london1">London, the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, has a history going back over 2,000 years. During that time it has
  grown to one of the world's most significant financial and cultural capital cities. It has withstood plague, devastating fire, civil war, aerial
  bombardment, terrorist attacks, and rioting.The City of London, often referred to simply as "the City", is Greater London's historic core and
  today is its primary financial district, though it now represents just a tiny part of the wider metropolis.

<p class="london2">Many parts of London, such as Islington or Highgate, were once villages (small towns). Today, London is a growing city with a
   population of more than seven million. People have come from all parts of the world to live here. They have brought with them different ways
    of living and colourful festivals. London is a multicultural city, as it has been since the Roman times. Now about a quarter of the capital's
    inhabitants are members of the ethnic minorities. Residents of London are known as "Londoners".

<p class="london3">
   London, the capital city of the United Kingdom, is the world's leading financial centre for international business and commerce and is one
    of the "command centres" for the global economy. The economy of London is dominated by service industries, particularly financial services
    and associated professional services, which have strong links with the economy in other parts of the United Kingdom and internationally.
    According to the Brookings Institution, in 2011 London had the fifth largest metropolitan economy in the world.
